Project Name: Alarm Clock
By-Kunjesh and Shivesh

 We use some of the following modules , functions and widgets which are different for what we use regularly in python language.
The project is based on tkinter module. 
1. Winsound-This is the module used for generating or playing sound or a sound file.This can be used to create sound like (beep...). 
This winsound module  is defined only for execution on a Windows Platform, hence the name WINsound.  syntax winsound.Beep(frequency,duration).
2. .after()-This method is used to call the given function after a given delay in ms. The syntax is given below..
    ".after(delay , function)"
3. .isdigit() -
      This function is used to check if the digit is entered in input.  If we enter a digit in input then the program proceeds or else the error message wil be shown.
Syntax : “(the thing you want to check).isdigit()”
4.  .entry -word
      entry widget is used to store single line text strings or any value.
   It will store them and use them in further code.
